	Lexor is fully working....

//parser

So in order to build a parse tree we used explicit function calling.Corresponding to each Token we have a case (i.e what functions to call)
We build the case based analysis using the Parse Table which we made using first and follow sets.Each functions returns a pointer to the corresponding subtree ...After getting the parse tree we print it.

Then pass this to AST.

Output : Token which are getting consumed  and as they are getting consumed.	

This is fully working.

//for AST...

Not Working 

but we have implemented a lot of functions reducing the number of nodes in the parse tree.

we have the parse tree from parser....

so what we did was reduce that parse tree in phases...

Phase 1: Reduce it...
	in this i have removed the parents ehcich have only one children...

Phase 2 : Remove useless tokens like { ,}  etc....

after this we will get a tree with terminals in just the next node to non terminals...
	
for the following phase i have written specific AST nodes for if ,for ,various point assignment method 1,point assignment method 2 etc etc
Phase 3  : Assignemnet handling...
	handle the assignment of point ,wall depending on the various types of declaration you have..
Phase 4: 
	Arithmetic Operator Handling...

Phase 5: if handling..

Phase 6 : for handling...


Were not able to complete:
	Error 1 .....expected ‘struct node *’ but argument is of type ‘struct FILE *’
 void _Reduce(struct node *root){
